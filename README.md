# **Speckit-plus**
- It is a cli-based framework capable of running an AI agent in it e.g. Gemini CLI, Codex, Claude code etc.
- We install this framework and select the agent we want to use for our project.
- Speckit-plus is a fork of the original framework known as Speckit from Github.


## **The 5 Core Concepts**:

## 1. _Constitution Phase_
- a document that defines project-wide quality standards applying to every work in a project.
- provides the model with core principles, key standards, constraints, and success criteria of the project in general.

## 2. _Specification Phase_
- specific instructions given to the model regarding what our individual project is about, how it should be created, what steps to take in its creation, what steps to avoid, etc.
- compared to constitution, it concerns the greater project's specific segment we plan to work on at a particular time.

## 3. _Planning Phase_
- This phase is all about how to implement the criteria setup in the specification phase.
- Spec defines WHAT (success criteria), Plan defines HOW (architecture).

## 4. _Task Phase_
- Spec defines WHAT (success criteria), Plan defines HOW (architecture), Tasks define WORK UNITS (15-30 min pieces).
- Research Foundation (sources + outline) → Content Research (gather all materials) → Writing and Synthesis (transform research into prose) → Review and Finalization (quality validation).



## 5. _Impementation Phase_
- This turns the specification and plan into reality by executing tasks with measurable validation.
- The core skill in this is validating task completion against specification success criteria at critical phase boundaries.
